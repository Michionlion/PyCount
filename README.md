# Py-Count ReadMe

## What does the project do?

- This project is a collaborative enhancement to import this tool into GatorGrader
to create new GatorGrader checks. The program utilizes LibCST, which parses Python
code as a CST (Concrete Syntax Tree) that keeps all formatting details (comments,
white spaces, parentheses, etc.)

## Why is the project useful?

- Within LibCST, it has many nodes to "match" modules, expressions, and
statements which allowed us as programmers to complete our user stories in a
more uniform way. This project is useful because of the exploration of LibCST.
