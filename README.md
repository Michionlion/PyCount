# PyCount ReadMe

## What does the project do?

- This project is a collaborative enhancement to import this tool into GatorGrader to create new GatorGrader checks. The program utilizes LibCST, which parses Python code as a CST (Concrete Syntax Tree) that keeps all formatting details (comments, whitespaces, parentheses, etc.)

## Why is the project useful?

- Within LibCST, it has many nodes to "match" modules, expressions, and statements which allowed us as programmers to complete our user stories in a more uniform way. This project is useful because of the exploration of LibCST.

## How users can get started with the project?

- TODO 

## Where can users get help with the project?

- Users who are having trouble with navigating the program can come to the ReadMe for assistance.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project?

- The people who maintain and contribute to this project are Alexis Caldwell(@caldwella2), Adriana Solis(@solisa986), Rachael Harris(@rachaelharris), Ramon Guzman(@guzmanr04), and Ryan Hilty(@RyanHiltyAllegheny).
